## Filtered Camera
This project is developed with Python and OpenCV to apply filters on real-time camera image using a four-window interface created with Qt Designer. The application shows different filters in each window and shows fps, date and time in the right and left corners of the image.I also used the numpy library.
### Project Content:

The interface consists of four windows, each designed to display a different filter. The interface also includes "Start" and "Finish" buttons.
#### Python ve OpenCV:
Applying filters to the camera image is done using the OpenCV library.
#### FPS, Date and Time Display:
